Source code of original front tool as documented in Jenkner et al. 2010, using the TFP. Used for eraint, as opposed to the version used for COSMO-2 that is used (as of early Jan. 2021) in stormtrack that doesn't use the TFP, but instead only the gradient of THE to compute fvel.

TODO: Implement option to use the gradient of TFP instead of THE to compute fvel and compare the two.
